# ES2015 examples

Just comment or uncomment the part of the code you want to run to understand ES2015 functionality.

Most of the functionality of ES2015 works already in node. For import and export statements though we need babel.

## Babel

```bash
npm install -g babel-core
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015
```

**.babelrc**

```
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
```
